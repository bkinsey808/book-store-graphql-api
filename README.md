# about

this is a project based originally off of the egghead course: https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-graphql-api-with-aws-cdk-and-appsync-7d2a5fbc
and converted to CDKv2 by yours truly.

CRUD WORKS!

This opens up opportunities for me to build out a full stack app with CDKv2 and AppSync.

# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
